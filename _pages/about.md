I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UC Davis, advised by [Dr. Aditya Thakur](https://thakur.cs.ucdavis.edu/). My research lies in the intersection of programming languages, machine learning, formal methods, and software engineering. My work focuses on the repair of deep neural networks with an emphasis on providing provable correctness guarantees. I am passionate about teaching and mentorship, particularly for women of color in computer science.

More About Me
------
I am the president of [Graduate Scholars of Color+](https://www.instagram.com/davis_gsoc/) at UC Davis, an organization that fosters community for graduate students of color across many disciplines and fields of study.

I completed my undergraduate degrees in mathematics and computer science at Santa Clara University. While at SCU, I researched sparse suffix tree algorithms, advised by [Dr. Nicholas Tran](https://algoplexity.com/~ntran/). [Dr. Tamsen McGinley](https://sites.google.com/view/tamsenwhiteheadmcginley/home) was also an incredible mentor in my mathematics journey!

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, solving the NY Times Crossword puzzles, and listening to K-Pop.
